> I view my Maker face to face,  
> O how shall I appear?  
> If yet, while pardon may be found,  
> And mercy may be sought,  
> My heart with inward horror shrinks,

> When thou, O Lord, shalt stand disclosed  
> In majesty severe,  
> And sit in judgement on my soul,  
> O how shall I appear?  
> But thou hast told the troubled mind

Well, Joseph Addison (1672-1719) doesn't sound excited for Judgement Day. I'd encourage you to [go play the music](https://hymn.singer.ga/listing/when_rising_from_the_bed_of_death.html), and hum or sing along to Tallis' THIRD MODE MELODY if you like. Its not well known, set in a somber Phrygian mode.

But Joseph, either because of the horror he expressed here or his sense of decency, refrained to detail why, really, "my heart with inward horror shrinks, and trembles at the thought;" What sort of "endless woe"? This isn't the trembling of a child on the receiving end of a "disappointed, not angry" scolding, but rather a child who knows with dread certainty what blows will come if she fails to offer "the timely tribute of her tears".

Joseph is thinking, and not writing, about the after-judgement, behind the blood-rusted gates. If you empathized with the lyrics at all, it was probably because you heard the details from church or family. His goal isn't to educate about hell; he knows you get the idea.

Actually, Jonathan Edwards came along in 1741 and let people know that they _really_ didn't get it. [_Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God_](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Sinners_in_the_Hands_of_an_Angry_God) meets with resounding success and kicks off the Great Awakening. I suspect the more successful writer doesn't leave hell to the imagination, otherwise the audience simply won't imagine it. Let a word be a word, and nothing more.

### The trembling child

(We'll gaze just a bit deeper into the Abyss, in case you'd prefer to leave.)

I was 6 years old, my brother 9. Playing out on the swings, he told me about hell. Probably learned about it from school. Eternity is like infinity, he told me. We understood infinity, as many children do, playing the 1-up game: "I'm one thousand times better", "I'm one million times better", "I'm _infinity_ times better!" (_Drops the toy microphone_). Add 100 or 1000000 more, and you go nowhere, don't even bother counting the zeros.

Not just eternity, though, but an eternity of _infinite suffering_. I don't remember exactly where my 6-year-old imagination went with that, but it scared the _hell_ out of me, pardon the over-used pun. "Infinity times infinity" wasn't something I understood yet. I immediately ceased playing and ran to my parents and got my soul saved by asking Jesus into my heart. I should ask them if they remember this.

But there was no confetti or glowing light, and I feared that my fear-motivated confession-of-faith wasn't up to snuff. Is that all? One mundane prayer to buy my passage on the not-tortured-for-eternity express? (Somehow heaven was never the focus for me)

There were a few sleepless nights, praying and re-praying variations on a theme: accepting the sacrifice that Jesus made, accepting Jesus into my heart and my Lord and Savior, accepting the free gift of salvation offered by him. Wouldn't want to have a lapse in coverage because you left out the right clause.

Tom and Jerry was my favorite cartoon at that age. "Perpetual cycles of violent emnity, but all suffering is transient (and funny)," it whispers.

Except the one where [tom goes to hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lZCtuTeyUw) at the end and is boiled in a cauldron, held down by a cackling dog-devil. A just punishment for failing to obtain Jerry's forgiveness in writing within his alotted time.

Oh, it was all a dream? Huh, somehow my imagination was stuck in the firey nightmare, damned by the fine print. Funny.

### One drop of empathy

> Oh, Thou who burn'st in Heart for those who burn  
> In Hell, whose fires thyself shall feed in turn;  
> How long be crying, ``Mercy on them, God!''  
> Why, who art Thou to teach, and He to learn?  

- Quatrains of Omar Khayyam

A little older, I would sit in the school gymnasium every morning, waiting for classes to start. Big room compared to my small self. Ventilation ducts bigger than me suspended from the ceiling.

How many air molecules in the room? Billions or trillions or quadrillions or quintillions? Knowing big numbers is cool at some stage of learning, but comprehending them not so important. Let a word be a word, and nothing more.

No. My lifespan is like one of those molecules, and once I have (God forbid) suffered infinitely in hell 10 years, I will graduate without ceremony to the next molecule. One molecule of suffering down, 50 thousand trillion trillion to go. Subtract 1 from infinity because time is passing, but you aren't going anywhere.

One drop, one molecule of empathy is too much against the abyssal ocean depths of suffering. It is lost in boiling currents, and pulls for more.

### The call to action

Enough of unguided dread! We Christians, having gained assurance (>90% or so), of our own soul's salvation, have a duty to catch the drop that is another human soul falling toward the Abyss. Infinity minus one is our goal. "You are not obligated to complete the work, but neither are you free to abandon it."

So let us not be frozen, trembling to the thought of the dread, but let it animate us. In that same gymnasium 6 years later, a chapel speaker shows this [Letter from Hell video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXPDa_CGjTE) reminding us that every passed-up opportunity to share the Gospel makes their eventual damnation our fault. That friendly woman who took your Taco Bell order? What if she finishes her shift, then is killed by a drunk driver on the commute? You were the last one God sent, her final hope, but you thought it would be too awkward with other's waiting in line. Don't let it get you down, she won't ever forgive you, but God already has through the power of Jesus.

"There are far more effective ways to save souls than supposing every chance encounter is God getting his foot in the proverbial door. Most people in the first world have 'heard the good news' many times already."

Absolutely! And I'm so glad you have a degree from an [accredited missionary training program](https://bethanygu.edu/blog/training/missionary-degrees/) so that you know the best strategies to prevent Eternal Torture Syndrome. Oh, Computer Science? Maybe that helps too.

But seriously, if you truly believe in hell (>10% chance), there is nothing else that matters. The darkness of eternity swallows any earthly endeavor. Everything I've said thus far has been to cut through the mental armor that the Christian mind builds up over the years to prevent these thoughts from triggering. But we are not free to abandon the task. Is Hell just a word?

We shy from the thought: our own kin, shuddering and pleading at God's left hand on Judgement day. I imagine perhaps God spares one sorrowful glance at them, before turning away, and giving the final signal. The screams begin.

So glad I'm not them.

### Psyche! The actual call to action

I've been insincere thus far, writing as if myself from 6 years ago. I feel a little bad for doing this, but I want to make sure the duty-bound Hell-believing Christians make it this far. (Others can skip to the next section)

...because you need to help me: I don't really believe that Jesus was the perfect child-sacrifice for my sins, or that God's wrath would be sated by the murder of a willing innocent. I don't think the Bible is particularly accurate or useful anymore.

I'm open-minded with the best of them, and totally willing to be convinced. You know I understand the stakes, I know you understand the stakes. Unless you're otherwise engaged in highly effective missionary work, I'm probably your most immediate opportunity. A great starting point would be to reconvince me the Bible is divinely inspired. (Hint: If you can find/replace "Bible" with "Quran" and imagine the argument coming from a Muslim, it's probably not a good argument)

So hey, I'd love to talk, here's my email: ____. I'm pretty friendly, or at least nicer than your God. If you don't reach out, just imagine me sending you that Letter from Hell tomorrow. "P.S. Wish you were here".

### I still pray

Many days, I beg God or whomever is out there to give me a sign, to reveal themselves to me. Is the "timely tribute of my tears" not timely enough? The predestinationists will say I was probably created for destruction.

Last night: My wife and I camp in our backyard, and I can't sleep. I take the time to think and pray and listen. I go and sit outside, listening to the 4 AM birds sing their hearts out. A sign? The moon flashes out of the corner of my bleary eyes? A sign?? When I turn my head a little, some twigs of tree silhouette a cross over the moon. A sign???

Maybe, but God doesn't seem to be trying very hard, and the beauty of a simple flower can only communicate so much theology. I'd prefer God to leave a message-of-the-day on every human palm: "The reformed presbyterians have it basically right. --God"

In fact, God seems quite determined to hide from worldly detection, using a deep understanding of statistics to only answer prayers in a fashion consistent with random chance. Devious.

How would we know if God disappeared one day? Flips on the universal auto-pilot ("I knew I designed physics for something!") and takes a few years off, would anyone notice?
Some people still randomly recover from illnesses, some people still tragically die.

It really seems, to an outside observer, that God doesn't want to be found or known. I'm happy to be proven wrong, even if God turns out to be hell-permittingly cruel.

I'm proud to say I have been wrong so, so many times in life. Optimistically: knowing you're wrong is an opportunity to be less wrong. Pessimistically: Following the pattern, I'm probably still wrong. Prescription: Epistemic humility, and maybe you'll be wiser tomorrow.

### Shifting gears into community

Have you ever seriously held a belief by yourself? Just you, not your friends or church? For me, every major belief shift needed a community for it to grow into. If there wasn't a community, I might suspect, but never convert.

My primary and secondary schooling was a religiously conservative school in Kansas. I learned to pity evolutionists and atheists and loved Left Behind: The Kids. I found a place of belonging in childish after-school activities with friends.

My Mennonite church was more moderate, and people generally avoided mentioning hell at all. I learned to "turn the other cheek" and loved the simplicity of absolute pacifism. I found a place of belonging in our youth group, where I first felt truly understood as an individual.

My Mennonite college was quite liberal, and I learned alternative theories of atonement and that LGBTQ people are amazing. I found a place of belonging going on long bike rides irresponsibly late at night with a buddy, shooting the moon and discovering the oft-neglected intimacy of friends.

I belonged, every step of the way, and it was wonderful, and so I believed. And my belief was reinforced by the knowledge that shared beliefs increase belonging.

If you've attended that accredited missionary training program, this comes as no surprise to you. Come for the cookies, stay for the community: You gotta plug new converts into a group of friends to give their faith some worldly stake. Humans stink at eternity, but friends they understand.

Now as I slip into agnosticism in the midst of a global pandemic, I'm wondering if I'll find community again. It's more of a challenge this time around, what with *waves hands at everything*.

### Confessions

Hell hurts in the worldly world, and I've used hell to hurt people.

I'm at a high school summer band camp, eating lunch with other campers. Somehow it comes up, I argue that Ghandi went to hell because he wasn't a Christian, and face opposition from tablemates. I stand true to the faith. Leading the opposition is a girl a year older and at least as emphatic. She says goodness definitely counts for more than theology. I didn't like her much at all. Tempers flared, but not too much. Not a bad lunch, overall, I think to myself.

Three years pass, and at high school church camp (small Mennonite world), coming back from a late night activity, I overhear a hushed conversation passing through the mess hall.

Did I hear that right? Her father had comitted suicide when she was young?

Oh my God... Have mercy... Did I...

I couldn't remember if I had ever said anything about suicide in particular, but I had _believed_ it. And whatever hypotheticals we had tossed around, there's no way she wasn't thinking of her dad.

Some Christians believe that suicide is in a special category of sins that bypasses the grace of God offered through Jesus. The Bible says nothing about it, but it's a common enough belief among hell-believers.

I'm so sorry, doubly so because I was always too scared to apologize to you or admit I was wrong.

### Slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love

...is not how I would describe a God who permits a hell like this. If God is all-powerful, then Hell exists because God prefers it. It's a backwards god who perceives the flames, understanding the full suffering, and seeing all that he had wrought, he says:

![this is fine](https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/9ef/336/775d89db9c8ffcd8589f3acdf37d0e323f-25-this-is-fine-lede-new.rhorizontal.w1200.jpg)

We do not praise parents that threaten to torture their children. We praise them for forgiving even the greatest insults, welcoming the prodigal home and throwing a feast. When the glory of God falls short of the glory of humans, something is not fine.

When common beliefs are so grimdark that children at play can seriously assert their friends are going to be tortured for eternity, and the supervising adult diplomatically encourages them to be more polite about expressing their beliefs, something is not fine.

When followers of Jesus condemn the Holocaust, then argue about the fine print of Damnation, whether it's about "age of accountability", "mortal sins", "gay people", or "exclusivism", and don't see the irony, something is not fine.

Children shouldn't have to be triggered by thoughts of Hell. Neither should adults. Unless it's real. But it's probably not. I hope.
